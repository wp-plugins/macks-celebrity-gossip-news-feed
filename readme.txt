== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who can help me out? =

Email: mack@jawer.org . No spam please.

= How many articles can I display? =

You can display between 1 and 12 articles, 12 being the maximum our feed contains.

= How do I resize the plugin output on my sidebar? =

Visit your Settings menu and click "Mack's Celebrity Gossip News Feed", and then edit the size and width to your requirements.

= Can I change the Feed's Colors? =

Not at this time, although we will work hard to make improvements that will address this concern.

= How do I turn off the Dashboard News Section? =

There are two ways. 1) Go to your dashboard and find the bottom of the news menu, then click the "X" button. Reload your page using your browser's "reload" button, and the feed will be permanently removed (unless you want it back :) ). 2) You can also remove the feed within your "Mack's NCAA Basketball News Feed" control panel.

= Gee, I liked the Dashboard News, how do I turn it back on or activate it again? =

Hurray! Go to "Mack's Celebrity Gossip News Feed" control panel and scroll towards the bottom of the page. You will see drop-down menu with options "Yes" or "No" to display the feed. Simply select "Yes" and then click "Save Settings", and the feed will return. Note, the dropdown menu defaults to showing "Yes", but if you've already deactivated the dashboard news feed, the feed won't display.
